# Leisure-C-Compiler
A C compiler written  from  scratch.

As its name suggests - the Leisure C Compiler. This is a compiler I wrote in my spare time, intended for relaxation, and of course, to pick up some knowledge along the way.

You can refer to the compiler as LiCC for short.

If you're interested, you can make some suggestions about the LeCC.

Thank You~!
